Users write and we measure keyboard input and brain data. We predict when the user will approach a roadblock, or when they do not write a customly defined number of words in a predefined time interval. If they hit a roadblock, we offer solutions such as recommending research articles, scaffolding questions, or taking a break.

**Features**
- Users write on a Google Docs document
- Keyboard input and brain data is collected in real-time from the user
- Brain data is collected using the Cyton OpenBCI EEG headset
- User can customize productivity standards which includes the number of words that need to be written and the time interval
- Recommended research articles and scaffolding questions are based on user's written content
- Number of breaks, their duration, and their frequency are measured in order to develop an individualized model for the user, maximizing their productivity

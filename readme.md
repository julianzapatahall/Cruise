# Cruise
Cruise is a writing efficiency tool that uses keyboard text input and EEG brain data to increase user productivity. Users can specify writing productivity thresholds (such as words per five minutes) defining a roadblock. Cruise predicts when the user will approach a roadblock and offers solutions such as recommending research articles, scaffolding questions, or taking a break. Solutions depend on previously defined thresholds and seek to maximize overall productivity.
